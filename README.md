The application is build as a thesis, and works as a help in designing sewage pumping station. 
User interface is build using pygubu designer https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu

This project helps me taking the first steps in git usage, also it is my first bigger project, so there are many refactors, commits, changing syntax, etc, because I'm learning much while developing.
